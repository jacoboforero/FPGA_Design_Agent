# Autonomous Design Agents Using Generative AI

## Overview

This project explores the use of Generative AI to accelerate hardware and software design workflows.  
The primary focus is on creating an autonomous agent capable of generating Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs, guided by iterative simulation feedback.

The long-term vision is to reduce time-to-market for new products by combining AI-driven code generation with industry-standard design and verification workflows.

## Goals

- Develop an autonomous self-working agent for RTL design.
- Build a system that:
  - Accepts a set of design requirements.
  - Generates candidate RTL code through AI models.
  - Refines solutions iteratively based on Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool simulation results.
- Ensure cost-effectiveness by exploring hybrid setups:
  - Small local LLMs.
  - Third-party hosted LLMs.

**Stretch Goal:** Expand to additional languages (e.g., C, C++) with automatic compiler selection.

## Deliverables

- Specifications of AI models used.
- Prompting methodology for code generation, testing, and refinement.
- Approach to extracting key simulation results and feeding them back into the AI loop.
- Benchmarks for evaluation and quantitative results.
- Production-ready application (GUI or console) that:
  - Accepts input benchmarks.
  - Generates working RTL output.
  - Captures and displays the full iterative AI dialogue.

## Technology

- **LLMs**
- **Simulation Tools**
- **OS**: Linux

## Why This Project

- Hands-on experience with Generative AI applied to hardware design.
- Exposure to RTL design and simulation workflows.
- Contribution to research with potential for publication.
