Title: 3-bit up counter with enable

L1 Functional intent
- Count up on each rising clock edge when enable is high.
- Wrap from 7 back to 0 on overflow.
- Output count[2:0] and an optional rollover pulse.
Reset rules
- Active-low async reset drives count to 0 and rollover to 0.
Edge cases
- If enable is low, hold the current count.
- Rollover asserted only for the cycle that wraps 7 -> 0.

L2 Interface
- clk (INPUT, 1)
- rst_n (INPUT, 1, async active-low)
- en (INPUT, 1)
- count (OUTPUT, 3)
- rollover (OUTPUT, 1)
Handshake semantics
- None (simple synchronous signals)
Params/defaults
- None

L3 Verification
Test goals
- Happy path count increments 0..7 and wraps.
- Reset forces count to 0 immediately.
- Enable gating holds count when en=0.
Oracle plan
- Reference model compares cycle-by-cycle count and rollover.
Stimulus strategy
- Directed sequences for reset, enable, and wrap.
Pass/fail criteria
- count matches reference and rollover only on wrap.
Coverage goals
- branch: 0.8
- toggle: 0.7

L4 Architecture
- Single 3-bit register and adder with wrap logic.
- No CDC; single clock domain.
- Latency: 1 cycle to observe increment.

L5 Acceptance
- RTL + TB + lint/sim clean.
- Coverage goals met.
- Exclusions: none.
